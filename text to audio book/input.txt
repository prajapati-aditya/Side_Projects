Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a kind old man. 
Every day, he would tell stories to the children of the village. 
The children loved listening to his tales of adventure, wisdom, and courage. 
One day, he told them about the importance of kindness and sharing. 
The children promised to follow his advice and spread happiness wherever they went.
